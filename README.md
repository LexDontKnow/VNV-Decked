# VNV-Decked
## Preamble
Welcome to my pathetic Viva New Vegas install guide for Steam Deck. First and foremost, a quick rundown of what this guide IS:
* a slightly modified (by way of ignoring a couple of essential mods and changing installation procedure) for a working and (seemingly) stable version of VNV on the Steam Deck.
* very basic and written by someone with very little modding knowledge
* written for Steam Deck users who do not have access to a PC storage link (if you have this, you should just [transfer an installation from your computer](https://gist.github.com/Haaroon/ca2d7afe8aab309ba64bb2852a68253a), you will have cleaner masters and texture decompression; more on this below).

What this guide IS NOT:
* supported or created by the official Viva New Vegas team, DO NOT take issues with this installation (nor during play afterwards) to the VNV discord, they will be ignored
* for Steam Deck users with a storage link to their PC (see above)
* a comprehensive guide for VNV, Fallout 3 modding, or anything else, really

Based on that, if you feel like this guide is for you, please continue along.

## Before You Begin

As with any mod list installation, you'll want to start with a clean install.
